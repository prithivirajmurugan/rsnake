## Keymap
- **W/A/S/D** or **Up/Left/Down/Right** - Controll snake direction.
- **R** - Restart the game.
- **ESC** - Quit the game.

## Known Flaws / ToDo List
- **R** has no effect yet.
- There should be an endscreen with restart / quit buttons.
- The fruit and snake could possibly spawn at the same coordinate / fruits can spawn inside the tail of the snake.
